Description: Contains wrapper functions for creating PDFs with better defaults (dimensions, margins, and overall spacing), labeling panels, and other random stuff I reuse extremely often.  For base R graphics.  Also sbatch functions to automate large submissions.  This was all written with me and my research lab in mind, not intended for broad use, but feel free to use it and give me feedback.
